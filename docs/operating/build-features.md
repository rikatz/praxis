# Build features

Praxis is composed at build time with Cargo *features*. Several subsystems
are optional so you can build a proxy that carries only what a deployment
needs: a smaller binary, a leaner dependency tree, or no external
observability and admin surface at all.

Most features are on by default. Build the standard binary with:

```console
cargo build -p praxis-proxy --release
```

which includes hot-reload, the admin surface, and the `policy` filter.

Build the leanest possible binary (every optional subsystem off) with:

```console
cargo build -p praxis-proxy --release --no-default-features
```

and add back individual features as needed:

```console
cargo build -p praxis-proxy --release --no-default-features --features admin-api
```

For a policy-free build that keeps everything else, name the features you want
instead:

```console
cargo build -p praxis-proxy --release --no-default-features \
    --features config-reload,admin-api
```

For that exact invocation the guarantee holds: every Praxis crate depends on
`praxis-proxy-filter` without dependency defaults, so dropping the server's
`policy-engine` feature leaves the filter's `policy-engine` off and the policy
engine's dependency tree out of the build. `make release-fips` is this build
with the feature list kept in one place; see [FIPS 140-3](fips.md) for what
that build is for and how to deploy it.

### Disabling the policy engine as a library consumer

The same holds when Praxis crates are embedded. Each crate that reaches the
filter (`praxis-proxy`, `praxis-proxy-protocol`) depends on it without
defaults and exposes its own `policy-engine` feature, forwarding to the
filter's. So:

- Depending on `praxis-proxy` (the server as a library) with
  `default-features = false` and naming the features you want gives a
  policy-free build; leaving defaults on gives the policy engine.
- Depending on `praxis-proxy-protocol` or `praxis-proxy-filter` directly gives
  no policy engine unless you enable `policy-engine` on them (the filter's own
  default is on, so set `default-features = false` on that edge to keep it
  off). `praxis-proxy-core` and `praxis-proxy-tls` never pull it.

Cargo unions features across the whole dependency graph, so one crate anywhere
in your graph that depends on `praxis-proxy-filter` with its defaults turns
`policy-engine` back on for everyone, and the `policy` filter then becomes
nameable in config in a build believed to be policy-free. Verify with
`cargo tree -e normal -i praxis-policy`: no output means the policy engine
really is out of the build.

## Feature summary

| Feature | Default | Enables | Turn it off / on when |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| `config-reload` | on | Config-file and TLS-certificate hot-reload (filesystem watching). | Off for a static-config deployment: drops both watchers and the `notify`, `arc-swap`, and `tokio` dependencies they pull into the TLS crate. |
| `admin-api` | on | The admin HTTP services: management API (`/api/*`) on `admin.address`, and `/healthy`, `/ready`, `/metrics` on `admin.metrics_address`. | Off when the proxy exposes no monitoring or management surface. The data path and background health checks are unaffected; only the HTTP endpoints go away. |
| `otel` | off | OpenTelemetry / OTLP span export for traces. | On for distributed tracing. Pulls in a heavy `opentelemetry` + `tonic` dependency graph. |
| `policy-engine` | on | The `policy` filter (Praxis Policy Engine: OPA-style route policy, JWT identity, token exchange). | Off for a deployment that does no policy-based authorization: it is the heaviest optional dependency, so dropping it is the largest single saving in build time and binary size. |
| `basic-auth-filter` | off (experimental) | The `basic_auth` filter. | Dev and testing only. Slated for removal in favor of the policy engine ([praxis-proxy/policy]); prefer that for authentication. |
| `cloud-events-filter` | off (experimental) | The `cloud_events` filter (serialize requests into CloudEvents and ship them to an HTTP receiver). | On for event export; delivery is best-effort. Adds `chrono` and `url`. |
| `upstream-binding` | off (experimental) | Logical upstream binding: the `router` publishes the matched cluster as a request-wide binding that `bound_upstream` conditions and `cluster_source: bound_upstream` load balancers read. | On when a pipeline gates filters on the bound cluster's application metadata or dispatches from the binding. Implied by the two features below. Off, those config forms are rejected at load time and the router never touches request extensions. |
| `iterative-request-router` | off (experimental) | The `iterative_request_router` filter: a bounded loop of sub-requests for provider failover and agentic/tool loops. | On for callout and failover pipelines (the AI gateway relies on it). No extra dependencies; pulls in `upstream-binding`, since its steps dispatch from the binding. |
| `router-json-aliases` | off (experimental) | The `router` filter's JSON-alias body-routing groundwork. | Groundwork only: it is not wired into routing, and a route that sets `json_aliases` is rejected at build even with the feature on. Default builds do not accept the keys. |
| `bound-upstream-request-body` | off (experimental) | The `HttpFilter::on_bound_upstream_request_body` hook, run once at the logical-binding barrier. | For out-of-tree filters that must inspect or rewrite the request body against the bound upstream; no in-tree filter uses it yet. Pulls in `upstream-binding`. |
| `chain-binding` | off (experimental) | The `register_chain_binding` outbound-callout API (`ChainBindingContext::bind_chain`) and its authority-bound deferred credentials (`PendingCredentials`, `DeferredCredential`). | For out-of-tree callout filters; no in-tree consumer yet. |
| `spiffe` | off (experimental) | SPIFFE X.509-SVID mTLS peer identity (the `require_named` listener mode) and the `peer_identity_trust` filter. | On for mTLS peer-identity authorization. Adds `spiffe` and `x509-parser`. |
| `dev` | off | Developer convenience bundle (currently enables `basic-auth-filter`). | Local development builds. |
| `experimental` | off | Marker feature set transitively by experimental features; drives a startup warning. | Not selected directly; it lights up when an experimental feature is enabled. |

## Experimental features

Several features are *experimental*: each is off by default, each turns on the
`experimental` marker feature transitively, and enabling any of them makes the
server log `experimental features are enabled that should not be used in
production` at startup. Do not run an experimental build in production.

- **`basic-auth-filter`** (deprecated): the `basic_auth` filter. Credentials
  live in plaintext config, so it is for development and testing only. Prefer
  the policy engine for authentication.
- **`cloud-events-filter`**: the `cloud_events` filter, which serializes a
  request into a CloudEvent and ships it to a configured HTTP receiver.
  Delivery is best-effort and never changes the client response; review its
  limitations before relying on it.
- **`upstream-binding`**: logical upstream binding. With it, a `router` in a
  pipeline that reads the binding publishes the matched cluster once per
  request, `bound_upstream` conditions match on that cluster's application
  metadata, and a `load_balancer` with `cluster_source: bound_upstream` picks
  an endpoint from it. Without it those two config forms fail validation and
  nothing in the request path changes. See
  [Upstream Binding](../architecture/upstream-binding.md).
- **`iterative-request-router`**: the `iterative_request_router` filter, a
  bounded loop of sequential sub-requests through named step pipelines. It
  powers provider failover and LLM agentic/tool loops and is the flagship
  consumer path for the AI gateway. Its streaming multi-step machine is
  high-complexity code that is still stabilizing.
- **`router-json-aliases`**: groundwork for routing on a JSON request-body
  field through the `router` filter. The matching primitives exist but are not
  wired into request routing, so a route that sets `json_aliases` is rejected
  at build even with the feature on. It is kept behind the flag for a future
  implementation; default builds do not carry the `json_aliases` keys at all.
- **`bound-upstream-request-body`**: the once-per-request bound-upstream
  request-body hook (`bound_upstream_request_body_access` and
  `on_bound_upstream_request_body` on `HttpFilter`). It runs right after the
  binding `router` freezes the request's
  [logical upstream binding](../architecture/upstream-binding.md), over the
  fully buffered body, and a read-write participant's output becomes the body
  forwarded, retried, and handed to the IRR. Logical binding itself is not
  gated; only this hook is. It has no in-tree consumer yet.
- **`chain-binding`**: the `register_chain_binding` extension API and
  `ChainBindingContext::bind_chain`, together with the authority-bound
  deferred-credential channel (`PendingCredentials` / `DeferredCredential`)
  that injects a secret into an outbound sub-request only when the resolved
  destination matches the authority the credential was issued for. This is the
  outbound-callout mechanism; it has no in-tree consumer yet and exists for
  out-of-tree callout filters.
- **`spiffe`**: SPIFFE X.509-SVID mutual-TLS peer identity, including the
  `require_named` listener client-cert mode, plus the `peer_identity_trust`
  filter that authorizes clients by mTLS peer identity. Note that
  `peer_identity_trust` works with any mTLS client certificate, not only
  SPIFFE, so a non-SPIFFE mTLS deployment must still build with `spiffe` to use
  it.

## Notes

- **Runtime still gates behavior.** Building with `admin-api` does not start
  the admin endpoints; they bind only when `admin.address` or
  `admin.metrics_address` is configured. A
  listener's `hot_reload: true` key takes effect only when the binary was
  built with `config-reload`; otherwise the certificate is served statically
  and a startup warning is logged.
- **The memory allocator is not a feature.** Praxis targets Linux and always
  uses `tikv-jemallocator`; there is no build toggle for it.
- **Where the savings are.** Dropping `policy-engine`, `config-reload`,
  `admin-api`, and `otel` is what trims the dependency tree and binary size,
  `policy-engine` by the widest margin. Most filters are always compiled in and
  share dependencies with the core proxy, so gating them individually would not
  remove a crate. The experimental filter gates (`upstream-binding`,
  `iterative-request-router`, `chain-binding`, `router-json-aliases`,
  `bound-upstream-request-body`) exist
  to keep unfinished or not-for-production surface out of default builds
  rather than to save a crate; `spiffe` and `cloud-events-filter` do
  additionally drop dependencies
  (`spiffe` + `x509-parser`, and `chrono` + `url` respectively).
