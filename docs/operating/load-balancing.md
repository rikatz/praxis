# Load Balancing

Praxis distributes requests across upstream endpoints
using configurable load-balancing strategies. Each
cluster selects a strategy independently, and all
strategies are health-aware - unhealthy endpoints are
automatically excluded from selection.

## Choosing a Strategy

| Strategy | Config value | Best for |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Round-robin | `round_robin` | General-purpose, uniform backends |
| Least connections | `least_connections` | Variable latency or cost |
| P2C | `p2c` | Large endpoint pools |
| Consistent hash | `consistent_hash` | Session affinity, caching |

The default strategy is `round_robin`. Set
`load_balancer_strategy` on a cluster to change it:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: least_connections
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
```

## Round-Robin

Cycles through endpoints in a fixed order. Each
endpoint receives traffic proportional to its weight.
This is the simplest strategy and works well when
backends are homogeneous and request cost is uniform.

With equal weights, round-robin produces an even
1:1:1 distribution across endpoints.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: round_robin
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
      - "10.0.0.3:8080"
```

**When to use:** most deployments. Start here unless
you have a specific reason to choose another
strategy.

**Trade-offs:** does not account for request
duration or backend load. A single slow backend
accumulates in-flight requests without relief.

## Least Connections

Routes each request to the endpoint with the fewest
active in-flight requests.

When two endpoints have equal connection counts, the
one with the higher weight wins the tie.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: least_connections
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
      - "10.0.0.3:8080"
```

**When to use:** backends with variable response
times (mixed fast/slow endpoints, heterogeneous
hardware, or request types with different costs).

**Trade-offs:** scans all endpoints on every
request. For clusters with many endpoints, consider
P2C instead.

## P2C (Power of Two Choices)

Samples two random endpoints and picks the one with
fewer in-flight requests. This achieves
near-optimal load distribution with O(1) selection
cost, regardless of the number of endpoints.

Higher-weight endpoints occupy more of the sampling
space and are chosen more often.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: p2c
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
      - "10.0.0.3:8080"
      - "10.0.0.4:8080"
      - "10.0.0.5:8080"
```

**When to use:** large endpoint pools (5+
endpoints) where scanning all endpoints per request
is wasteful. P2C is preferred over least connections
for large clusters.

**Trade-offs:** with only 2 endpoints, P2C is
equivalent to least connections. With a single
endpoint, it returns that endpoint directly. The
randomized sampling means traffic is not perfectly
even, but the "power of two choices" property
ensures load remains well-balanced in practice.

## Consistent Hash

Hashes a stable request attribute to always route
the same key to the same endpoint. This provides
session affinity without server-side session storage.

The hash ring is built at startup from virtual nodes.
Each endpoint receives virtual nodes proportional to
its weight - an endpoint with weight 3 occupies
three times as many ring positions as one with
weight 1. The hash function is FNV-1a (64-bit),
chosen for speed and determinism.

### Hash Key Selection

By default, the hash key is the request URI path.
Set `header` to hash on a specific request header
instead:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy:
      consistent_hash:
        header: "X-User-Id"
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
      - "10.0.0.3:8080"
```

When the configured header is absent from a request,
the hash falls back to the URI path. Omit `header`
(or pass an empty object) to always hash on the URI
path:

```yaml
load_balancer_strategy:
  consistent_hash: {}
```

### Endpoint Changes

`consistent_hash` is weighted modulo hashing: the
key selects slot `fnv1a(key) % Σweight`. Adding or
removing an endpoint changes `Σweight` and therefore
remaps most keys, not `1/N` of them. Use `ring_hash`
or `maglev` when minimal disruption on endpoint
changes matters (for example, caching layers that
depend on cache locality).

### Security Note

FNV-1a is unkeyed. An attacker who knows the backend
addresses can craft header values to target a
specific backend. For adversarial environments, pair
consistent hashing with rate limiting.

**When to use:** session affinity, cache locality,
or any case where the same input should
consistently reach the same backend.

**Trade-offs:** not load-aware. If one hash key
generates disproportionate traffic, its assigned
backend bears the full load. Combine with health
checks so that a failing backend's traffic shifts
to the next ring position.

## Weighted Endpoints

All strategies respect endpoint weights. Weights
are relative integers (minimum 1). The ratios
matter, not the absolute values - `(1, 3)` and
`(2, 6)` produce identical distributions.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: round_robin
    endpoints:
      - address: "10.0.0.1:8080"
        weight: 1
      - address: "10.0.0.2:8080"
        weight: 3
```

In this example, `10.0.0.2` receives 3 out of every
4 requests. Endpoints without an explicit weight
default to 1. You can mix weighted and unweighted
endpoints in the same cluster:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - "10.0.0.1:8080"               # weight 1
  - address: "10.0.0.2:8080"
    weight: 3                      # weight 3
  - "10.0.0.3:8080"               # weight 1
```

How weights affect each strategy:

| Strategy | Weight behavior |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Round-robin | More rotation slots |
| Least connections | Tie-breaker at equal load |
| P2C | Larger random sampling space |
| Consistent hash | More virtual ring nodes |

**Round-robin:** higher weight gives an endpoint
more slots in the cumulative weight cycle.
**Least connections:** when two endpoints have equal
in-flight counts, the higher-weight endpoint wins.
**P2C:** higher weight occupies a larger share of
the random sampling space, increasing selection
probability. **Consistent hash:** higher weight
creates more virtual nodes on the hash ring.

### Use Cases

- **Canary rollouts:** give the canary endpoint
  weight 1 and the stable endpoints weight 9 to
  send 10% of traffic to the canary.
- **Heterogeneous hardware:** assign weights
  proportional to backend capacity (e.g. a machine
  with 8 cores gets weight 4, a 2-core machine
  gets weight 1).
- **Gradual migration:** shift traffic between old
  and new backends by adjusting weights across
  config reloads.

## Health-Aware Routing

All strategies automatically exclude unhealthy
endpoints when health state is available. The load
balancer receives health state from the
[health checking](health-checking.md) subsystem and
filters the endpoint list before selection.

When an endpoint is marked unhealthy:

- **Round-robin** recomputes the healthy weight
  total and selects only from healthy endpoints.
  Traffic redistributes proportionally among the
  remaining healthy endpoints.
- **Least connections** and **P2C** skip unhealthy
  endpoints during their scans. P2C collects only
  healthy candidates into its sampling pool.
- **Consistent hash** probes adjacent ring slots
  when the primary slot's endpoint is unhealthy,
  walking the ring until a healthy endpoint is found.

Without health checks configured, all endpoints are
always considered available.

## Panic Mode

When every endpoint in a cluster is unhealthy, the
load balancer enters panic mode: it ignores health
state and routes to all endpoints using the
configured strategy as if no health data existed.

This prevents a complete traffic blackout. Panic
mode is logged at `warn` level:

```text
WARN all endpoints unhealthy, routing to all
  (panic mode) cluster=backend
```

Panic mode ends automatically when health checks
recover at least one endpoint.

**Rationale:** sending requests to potentially
unhealthy backends is preferable to returning 503 to
every client. Some of those backends may have
recovered between health check probes.

## Connection Options

Each cluster can configure connection timeouts and
limits alongside the load-balancing strategy:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: backend
    load_balancer_strategy: least_connections
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:8080"
      - "10.0.0.2:8080"
    connection_timeout_ms: 3000
    read_timeout_ms: 30000
    write_timeout_ms: 10000
    idle_timeout_ms: 60000
    total_connection_timeout_ms: 5000
    max_connections: 100
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `connection_timeout_ms` | TCP handshake timeout |
| `total_connection_timeout_ms` | TCP + TLS handshake combined |
| `read_timeout_ms` | Per-read timeout on established connections |
| `write_timeout_ms` | Per-write timeout on established connections |
| `idle_timeout_ms` | Idle pooled connection timeout |
| `max_connections` | Max concurrent requests; excess gets 503 |

All fields are optional. Omitted fields use
Pingora's built-in defaults.

### Upstream HTTP Version

Praxis speaks HTTP/1.1 to upstreams by default. A cluster
can opt into HTTP/2, which gRPC upstreams require — a gRPC
call's outcome arrives in response trailers, and no
HTTP/1.1 leg carries those:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: grpc-backend
    endpoints:
      - "10.0.0.1:50051"
    http:
      version: h2
```

| Value | Behaviour |
| ----- | --------- |
| `h1` | HTTP/1.1 only (default) |
| `h2` | HTTP/2 only: ALPN `h2` over TLS, prior-knowledge h2c over plaintext |
| `auto` | Prefer HTTP/2, fall back to HTTP/1.1 |

`h2` over plaintext assumes the endpoint speaks h2c; there
is no negotiation to fall back on, so a server that does
not fails to connect. `auto` has nothing to negotiate with
over plaintext either and stays on HTTP/1.1 there — it is
only meaningful for TLS upstreams.

Response trailers ride on the HTTP/2 leg only, so any
feature that reads them — the `grpc_status` access log
fields, the `grpc_web` filter — needs `h2` here to do
anything at all.

## Complete Example

A production-like configuration with multiple
clusters, weighted endpoints, health checks, and
different strategies:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: default

    filter_chains:
      - main

          - name: api

            endpoints:
              - address: "10.0.0.1:8080"
                weight: 3
              - address: "10.0.0.2:8080"
                weight: 3
              - address: "10.0.0.3:8080"
                weight: 1
            connection_timeout_ms: 3000
            max_connections: 200

          - name: cache
            load_balancer_strategy:
              consistent_hash:
                header: "X-Cache-Key"
            endpoints:
              - "10.0.1.1:8080"
              - "10.0.1.2:8080"
              - "10.0.1.3:8080"
```

## Cluster Source

By default a `load_balancer` reads the target
cluster from `ctx.cluster`, which a preceding
`router` set (`cluster_source: router`). It can
instead read `cluster_source: bound_upstream`
(with the off-by-default `upstream-binding` build
feature), resolving the frozen logical binding a
binding router published and selecting an endpoint
with no second router. This is how a direct dispatch
branch picks an endpoint from a cluster that was
bound once earlier in the pipeline; an
`iterative_request_router` step (the
`iterative-request-router` feature) can do the same
on every exchange. See
[Upstream Binding](../architecture/upstream-binding.md) and the complete
[`bound-upstream-dispatch.yaml`](../../examples/configs/traffic-management/bound-upstream-dispatch.yaml)
example.

```yaml
- filter: router
  routes:
    - path_prefix: "/openai/"
      cluster: openai
    - path_prefix: "/"
      cluster: chat
- filter: headers
  conditions:
    - when:
        bound_upstream:
          application_provider: openai
  branch_chains:
    - name: direct
      rejoin: terminal
      chains:
        - name: direct-dispatch
          filters:
            - filter: load_balancer
              cluster_source: bound_upstream
              clusters:
                - name: openai
                  http:
                    application_provider: openai
                  endpoints: ["10.0.0.1:8080"]
- filter: load_balancer
  clusters:
    - name: chat
      endpoints: ["10.0.0.2:8080"]
```

Startup validation makes sure every cluster the router can
bind reaches a load balancer that declares it; the runtime
error below is only a backstop. Bound
mode seeds `ctx.cluster` so retry, passive health, endpoint reselection, and
response cleanup use the bound cluster. A different existing `ctx.cluster`
fails closed before endpoint selection, preventing retry or health state from
one cluster being applied to another. A missing binding, an undeclared bound
cluster, or a conflicting exchange cluster produces a 500 filter error; an
unreachable selected endpoint remains a 502 transport error. When
`ctx.upstream` is already set, the load balancer skips selection entirely and
does not overwrite either the existing upstream or `ctx.cluster`.

## Dynamic Reload

Load-balancing configuration is dynamically
reloadable. Changing endpoints, weights, or
strategies in the config file triggers a pipeline
rebuild without restarting the proxy. In-flight
requests complete on the previous configuration.
See [configuration](configuration.md) for reload
details.

## Strategy Decision Guide

Use this flowchart to choose a strategy:

1. **Do you need session affinity?** Use
   `consistent_hash` with the appropriate header.
2. **Do backends have uniform latency?** Use
   `round_robin`. Add weights if hardware differs.
3. **Do backends have variable latency?**
   - Fewer than 5 endpoints: use
     `least_connections`.
   - 5 or more endpoints: use `p2c`.
4. **Unsure?** Start with `round_robin` (the
   default) and switch if monitoring reveals uneven
   load.
