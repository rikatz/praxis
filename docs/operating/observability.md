# Observability

Praxis exposes Prometheus metrics, structured access
logs, and health endpoints for monitoring proxy
behavior. This guide covers setup, metric reference,
logging configuration, and usage patterns.

## Admin and Metrics Endpoints

Health and metrics endpoints use a dedicated listener. Configure
`admin.metrics_address`; the separate `admin.address` is reserved for `/api/*`:

```yaml
admin:
  metrics_address: "127.0.0.1:9902"
```

The health and metrics listener exposes these endpoints:

| Path | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/healthy` | Liveness probe - returns `200` once the server is accepting connections |
| `/ready` | Readiness probe - returns cluster health status; `503` when any cluster has zero healthy endpoints |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus text exposition format |

The separate `admin.address` listener exposes the management API, including
`/api/log-level`. The admin API is restricted to loopback by default and
requires `insecure_options.allow_public_admin: true` for a non-loopback bind.
The health and metrics listener may bind to a non-loopback address without
that flag; use network controls to restrict access because it has no
authentication.

A loopback listener answers `421` on every path
unless `Host` is a loopback IP literal or `localhost`
(a request without `Host` is served), which blocks
DNS rebinding attacks from a browser. Point probes and
scrapers at `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, or `localhost`. See
[Admin DNS Rebinding](security-hardening.md#admin-dns-rebinding).

The admin and health/metrics surfaces are compiled
in by the `admin-api` build feature, on by default. A
binary built without it exposes no admin endpoints
regardless of either address. See
[Build Features](build-features.md).

### Verbose Readiness

By default, `/ready` returns aggregate counts only
(total, healthy, degraded clusters) without cluster
names. Set `verbose: true` to include per-cluster
detail:

```yaml
admin:
  metrics_address: "127.0.0.1:9902"
  verbose: true
```

Non-verbose response (default):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "clusters": {
    "total": 2,
    "healthy": 2,
    "degraded": 0
  }
}
```

Verbose response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "clusters": {
    "total": 2,
    "healthy": 2,
    "degraded": 0,
    "detail": {
      "api": {
        "healthy": 3,
        "unhealthy": 0,
        "total": 3
      },
      "web": {
        "healthy": 2,
        "unhealthy": 0,
        "total": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verbose mode exposes internal topology (cluster
names, endpoint counts). Keep it off in production
unless the health/metrics listener is network-isolated.

### Runtime log levels (`/api/log-level`)

Adjust process tracing verbosity at runtime without
restarting. The admin API layers temporary overlays on
top of the startup baseline (`RUST_LOG` plus
`runtime.log_overrides`). Overlays auto-revert after
`duration_secs` (default **300** seconds, maximum
**86400**).

| Method | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `PUT` | Set a global or per-module overlay |
| `GET` | Read baseline, active overlays, and effective directive |
| `HEAD` | Same as `GET` without a body |
| `DELETE` | Clear overlay(s) before timer expiry (`?module=`, or `?all=true`) |

Example per-module temporary raise:

```http
PUT /api/log-level
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "module": "praxis_filter::pipeline",
  "level": "trace",
  "duration_secs": 300
}
```

`GET /api/log-level` returns structured JSON including
`baseline_directive`, `overlays` (with `expires_at` in
RFC 3339 UTC), and `effective_directive`. Invalid
levels, empty `module`, and out-of-range durations
return **400** JSON errors.

## Metrics Reference

Praxis records Prometheus metrics in three
categories: HTTP request metrics, TCP connection
metrics (both always on when admin is enabled), and
per-filter duration histograms (opt-in).

Recorder upkeep runs every five seconds whenever the
admin endpoint is enabled. It is independent of
Prometheus scrape traffic, so histogram buffers are
drained even when `/metrics` is not being scraped.

### HTTP Request Metrics

These are recorded automatically for every proxied
request when the admin endpoint is enabled.

#### `praxis_http_requests_total` (counter)

Total completed HTTP requests.

| Label | Values |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `method` | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `CONNECT`, `OTHER` |
| `status_class` | `1xx`, `2xx`, `3xx`, `4xx`, `5xx`, `unknown` |
| `route` | Route path-match pattern (e.g. `/api/*`), a configured path template, or `"unknown"` |
| `cluster` | Cluster name or `"none"` |

Non-standard HTTP methods (e.g. `PURGE`) are
collapsed to `OTHER` to bound cardinality. Status
code `0` (no response written) maps to `unknown`.

#### `praxis_http_request_duration_seconds` (histogram)

Wall-clock duration of completed HTTP requests in
seconds. Uses the same label set as
`praxis_http_requests_total`.

#### `praxis_http_active_requests` (gauge)

HTTP requests currently in flight, incremented when a
request is admitted and decremented when it finishes.

| Label | Values |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `listener` | Listener name from config |

Requests rejected by overload protection (memory
pressure, file descriptor pressure, global or
per-listener connection limits) are never admitted and
do not appear here. The
decrement is tied to the request context's lifetime,
so it also fires when a client aborts mid-body or an
HTTP/2 stream is reset.

This series carries only HTTP requests; TCP
connections are tracked separately by
`praxis_tcp_active_connections`.

### Error Metrics

#### `praxis_errors_total` (counter)

Proxy errors, classified by cause.

| Label | Values |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `type` | `filter_reject`, `timeout`, `upstream_unavailable`, `upstream_protocol`, `downstream`, `internal` |

| Type | Meaning |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `filter_reject` | A filter or a request-body limit rejected the request |
| `timeout` | An upstream connect, read or write timed out |
| `upstream_unavailable` | The upstream could not be reached |
| `upstream_protocol` | The upstream was reached but the exchange failed |
| `downstream` | The client connection failed |
| `internal` | An internal proxy fault |

The error type is classified at the sites that
terminate a request (the terminal failure hook and
the request- and body-filter rejection paths) and
recorded first-write-wins on the request context. The
counter is incremented once per request, from the same
hook that records `praxis_http_requests_total`, so a
request that fails and retries counts once rather than
once per attempt.

Overload rejections are counted by
`praxis_overload_rejects_total` and are not repeated
here. Connect failures do appear under
`upstream_unavailable` as well as in
`praxis_upstream_connect_failures_total`, so this
counter stands on its own as an error denominator
rather than needing the connect-failure counter added
in.

### Overload and Process Metrics

#### `praxis_overload_rejects_total` (counter)

Requests (HTTP) and connections (TCP) rejected by
overload protection before any filter runs. HTTP
rejections answer `503` with `Retry-After`; TCP
rejections close the connection.

| Label | Values |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `reason` | `memory`, `file_descriptors`, `global_connections`, `listener_connections` |

`file_descriptors` counts requests shed because open
descriptors neared the process limit (see
`runtime.shed_on_fd_pressure`). A steady rate means
the limit is too small for the traffic.

#### `praxis_process_open_fds` / `praxis_process_max_fds` (gauges)

File descriptors the process holds open, and its soft
open file limit (`RLIMIT_NOFILE`). Sampled in the
background on Linux; absent elsewhere. Alert well
before the ratio reaches the shedding threshold (the
limit less 5%, or less 64 on small limits). The admin
`/api/stats` view reports the same numbers under
`file_descriptors`.

### Rate Limit Metrics

#### `praxis_rate_limit_limited_total` (counter)

Requests that exceeded a `rate_limit` filter's
bucket, summed over every `rate_limit` entry in the
process.

| Label | Values |
| -------- | --------------- |
| `shadow` | `true`, `false` |

`shadow="false"` counts requests rejected with
`429`. `shadow="true"` counts requests that a
`shadow: true` limit would have rejected but let
through: the number to watch when tuning a new
limit before enforcing it.

### Upstream Metrics

#### `praxis_upstream_requests_total` (counter)

Requests that reached an upstream endpoint.

| Label | Values |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cluster` | Cluster name or `"none"` |
| `endpoint` | Configured upstream address (`host:port`) |
| `status_class` | `1xx`, `2xx`, `3xx`, `4xx`, `5xx`, `unknown` |

Counted once per request, so a request retried across
endpoints increments once, against the endpoint that
answered. Requests that never reached an upstream
(filter rejections, connect failures) are absent
here but still counted by
`praxis_http_requests_total`, so the difference
between the two is proxy-generated responses.

The `endpoint` label is the address as configured,
not the resolved peer, so its cardinality is bounded
by the config rather than by DNS. Series are never
removed, though, even across reloads: a deployment
whose endpoints change over time (for example
endpoints generated from pod IPs) keeps a set of
series for every address it has ever configured, and
`/metrics` grows with each one. Disable the `endpoint`
dimension there (see [Metric Label Sets](#metric-label-sets)).

### TCP Connection Metrics

These are recorded automatically for every TCP
connection when the admin endpoint is enabled.

#### `praxis_tcp_connection_duration_seconds` (histogram)

Wall-clock lifetime of a TCP connection from accept
to close, in seconds.

| Label | Values |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `listener` | Listener name from config |
| `reason` | `completed`, `error`, `shutdown`, `session_timeout`, `max_duration`, `sni_timeout`, `filter_rejection`, `connect_failure`, `peeked_write_error` |

The `reason` label captures why the connection
closed:

| Reason | Meaning |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `completed` | Normal forwarding finished (both directions saw EOF) |
| `error` | Forwarding stopped on an I/O error |
| `shutdown` | The server shut down while forwarding |
| `session_timeout` | The idle `session_timeout` elapsed |
| `max_duration` | The overall `max_duration` elapsed and the session was force-closed |
| `sni_timeout` | SNI peek timed out before routing |
| `filter_rejection` | Connect filters rejected the connection |
| `connect_failure` | Upstream connection failed |
| `peeked_write_error` | Writing peeked bytes to upstream failed |

The first five reasons are reported after the
forwarding phase; the last four are early closes that
never reached forwarding.

#### `praxis_tcp_connections_total` (counter)

Total accepted TCP connections.

| Label | Values |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `listener` | Listener name from config |

Incremented once per accepted connection after
overload checks pass. Use with
`praxis_tcp_active_connections` to derive connection
rates and concurrency.

#### `praxis_tcp_bytes_sent_total` / `praxis_tcp_bytes_received_total` (counters)

Bytes forwarded over TCP connections, from the
proxy's point of view: `received` is the
client-to-upstream direction, `sent` is
upstream-to-client.

| Label | Values |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `listener` | Listener name from config |

Recorded once per connection after forwarding ends.
A session ended by an idle timeout, a server
shutdown, or the `max_duration` force-close still
reports the bytes it actually forwarded. Peeked TLS
`ClientHello` bytes are included in `received`.

#### `praxis_tcp_active_connections` (gauge)

TCP connections currently open, incremented on accept
and decremented when the session ends.

| Label | Values |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `listener` | Listener name from config |

Connections rejected by overload protection are never
accepted and do not appear here. Early closes (SNI
timeout, filter rejection, connect failure) decrement
the gauge on the same path they log on.

This series carries only TCP connections; HTTP
requests are tracked separately by
`praxis_http_active_requests`.

### Metric Label Sets

Every label dimension is emitted by default. In
large deployments the combination of dimensions can
produce more time series than a Prometheus server
should hold, so each can be turned off individually:

```yaml
metrics:
  labels:
    disabled:
      - route
      - endpoint
```

| Dimension | Default | Grows with |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `cluster` | on | Configured clusters |
| `endpoint` | on | Upstream endpoints |
| `listener` | on | Configured listeners |
| `method` | on | Bounded: ten values |
| `route` | on | Configured routes, or path templates |
| `status_class` | on | Bounded: six values |

Disabling a dimension drops it from every metric
that carries it; the metric itself stays available,
with the series that differed only by that dimension
collapsed into one. `endpoint` and `route` are the
usual candidates, since they grow with traffic shape
rather than with config size.

The one exception is `cluster` on the per-cluster
health gauges (`praxis_upstream_healthy_endpoints`
and `praxis_upstream_total_endpoints`): those gauges
are set rather than summed, so dropping the label
would collapse every cluster onto one last-writer
series rather than lowering cardinality. Disabling
`cluster` therefore drops it from the additive
cluster metrics but keeps it on those two gauges.

Label selection is read once at startup and is not
hot-reloadable; changing the label set requires a
restart.

Templates are compiled at startup and indexed by
segment count, so matching costs one walk of the
request's path segments and uses no regular
expressions.

### Filter Duration Histograms

Per-filter hook timing is opt-in. Enable it in the
`metrics` section:

```yaml
metrics:
  filter_duration: true
```

#### `praxis_filter_duration_seconds` (histogram)

Wall-clock duration of a single filter hook
invocation in seconds.

| Label | Values |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `filter` | Filter name (e.g. `router`, `rate_limiter`, `access_log`) |
| `phase` | `request`, `bound_upstream`, `selected_upstream`, or `response` |
| `stream` | `headers` or `body` |

The six hook combinations are:

| Phase + Stream | Hook |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| `request` + `headers` | `on_request` |
| `request` + `body` | `on_request_body` |
| `bound_upstream` + `body` | `on_bound_upstream_request_body` (experimental `bound-upstream-request-body` builds) |
| `selected_upstream` + `body` | `on_selected_upstream_request_body` |
| `response` + `headers` | `on_response` |
| `response` + `body` | `on_response_body` |

`bound_upstream` and `selected_upstream` pair only with
`body`; neither phase has a header hook.

Enabling `filter_duration` without `admin.metrics_address`
records metrics internally but does not expose them.
A startup warning is logged in this case.

## Prometheus Scrape Configuration

The `/metrics` endpoint returns Prometheus text
exposition format with content type
`text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`.

Example `prometheus.yml` scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: praxis
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - "127.0.0.1:9902"
```

When Prometheus scrapes pod IPs, bind the metrics listener to a non-loopback
interface. This listener does not require `insecure_options.allow_public_admin`;
that setting applies only to the admin API listener:

```yaml
admin:
  metrics_address: "0.0.0.0:9902"
```

Restrict access to the metrics port with network controls.

For Kubernetes deployments with multiple replicas,
use service discovery:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: praxis
    scrape_interval: 15s
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels:
          - __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app
        regex: praxis
        action: keep
      - source_labels:
          - __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port
        target_label: __address__
        regex: (.+)
        replacement: "${1}"
        action: replace
```

## PromQL Queries

### Request Rate

Requests per second by status class:

```promql
sum by (status_class) (
  rate(praxis_http_requests_total[5m])
)
```

### Error Rate

Percentage of 5xx responses:

```promql
sum(rate(praxis_http_requests_total{status_class="5xx"}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(praxis_http_requests_total[5m]))
```

### Request Latency Percentiles

p50, p95, and p99 latency:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.50,
  sum by (le) (
    rate(praxis_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (le) (
    rate(praxis_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

### Latency by Cluster

p99 latency broken down by upstream cluster:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (le, cluster) (
    rate(praxis_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

### Slowest Filters

p95 filter execution time, ranked:

```promql
topk(10,
  histogram_quantile(0.95,
    sum by (le, filter) (
      rate(praxis_filter_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
    )
  )
)
```

### Filter Duration by Phase

Compare request vs response processing time for a
specific filter:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum by (le, phase) (
    rate(
      praxis_filter_duration_seconds_bucket{filter="router"}[5m]
    )
  )
)
```

## Access Logging

Praxis uses the `access_log` filter for structured
request/response logging. By default each record is
emitted through the `tracing` subscriber, alongside
process logs. A `sink` can instead write records
straight to stdout or a dedicated file — see
[Output Sinks](#output-sinks).

### Enabling Access Logs

Add the `access_log` filter to your filter chain:

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: observability
    filters:
      - filter: request_id
      - filter: access_log
```

Each completed request emits a structured log entry
with these fields:

| Field | Description |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `method` | HTTP method |
| `path` | Request path (sanitized) |
| `client_ip` | Client IP address |
| `status` | Response status code |
| `duration_ms` | Request duration in milliseconds |
| `cluster` | Upstream cluster name or `-` |
| `upstream` | Upstream address or `-` |
| `request_id` | Correlation ID or `-` |
| `request_body_bytes` | Request body size |
| `response_body_bytes` | Response body size |

### gRPC Fields

A gRPC call's outcome is not its HTTP status — that is
`200` even for a failed call. It arrives in the response
trailers instead, so these fields are opt-in via `fields:`
and render `-` for non-gRPC responses:

| Field | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `grpc_status` | Numeric `grpc-status` (e.g. `5`) |
| `grpc_status_name` | Canonical name (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`) |
| `grpc_message` | `grpc-message`, percent-encoded as received |
| `grpc_status_details_bin` | `grpc-status-details-bin`, base64 as received |

```yaml
- filter: access_log
  fields: [method, path, status, grpc_status, grpc_status_name]
```

Trailers exist only on an HTTP/2 upstream leg, so the
cluster must set `http.version: h2` — see
[Upstream HTTP Version](load-balancing.md#upstream-http-version).
`grpc_message` is logged in its wire form: decoding it
would put control characters into a log line.

### Sampling

For high-traffic deployments, reduce log volume with
`sample_rate`:

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: observability
    filters:
      - filter: access_log
        sample_rate: 0.1
```

`sample_rate` accepts values in `(0.0, 1.0]`. The
value `0.1` logs 10% of requests. Sampling uses a
deterministic counter (of the first N requests,
exactly `floor(N × sample_rate)` are logged), not
random selection.

### Log Format

Set `PRAXIS_LOG_FORMAT=json` for structured JSON
output suitable for log aggregation pipelines:

```console
PRAXIS_LOG_FORMAT=json cargo run -p praxis-proxy
```

The default format is human-readable text. Both
formats include the same structured fields.

### Output Sinks

By default access records flow through the `tracing`
subscriber, so they share formatting, level filtering,
and destination with process logs. A `sink` detaches
them onto a dedicated writer that always emits NDJSON
(one JSON object per line), bypassing the subscriber and
its INFO-level gate:

```yaml
- filter: access_log
  sink:
    type: file                         # `stdout` or `file`
    path: /var/log/praxis/access.log   # required for `file`
```

Sinks are **best effort**. Each sink hands records to a
background writer through a bounded queue (8192 records);
once the queue is full — a slow or stalled disk, a burst
faster than the writer drains — further records are
dropped rather than blocking request handling, and a
warning reports the running drop count. Use a sink for
operational visibility, not as the system of record for
audit-grade logging.

`{type: stdout}` writes to the same stdout as the
process logs, so the two interleave unless you send
process logs elsewhere with `runtime.logging.output`
(`stderr` or `file`) — see
[Process Logging Destination](#process-logging-destination).
`{type: file}` opens the path in append mode (no
rotation); secure its permissions and rotate it
externally.

Warnings raised while the config is loaded and
validated (active `insecure_options`, degraded upstream
TLS, likely filter config typos) are emitted before the
configured subscriber exists, so they go to stderr in
this format. `--validate` and `--dump` stop there. On
the serving path the active `insecure_options` are
warned about again once logging is initialized, so
`runtime.logging.output` records them as well.

### Log Level Overrides

Control per-module log verbosity via
`runtime.log_overrides` in your config:

```yaml
runtime:
  log_overrides:
    praxis_filter::pipeline: trace
    praxis_protocol: debug
```

The base log level comes from the `RUST_LOG`
environment variable (defaults to `info`). Overrides
are additive - they set the level for specific
modules without changing the base level. Valid
levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

Each filter hook runs in its own `filter` span
(`filter:<name>:<phase>` in OpenTelemetry). These spans
are at `debug` level, so the default `info` level does
not create them and adds no per-filter tracing cost. To
export them, raise the pipeline module:
`praxis_filter::pipeline: debug`.

### Process Logging Destination

`runtime.logging` controls where Praxis writes process
logs (the `tracing` subscriber backing access logs and
startup messages). It is separate from
`runtime.log_overrides`, which only adjusts per-module
filter levels.

```yaml
runtime:
  log_overrides:
    praxis_filter::pipeline: debug
  logging:
    output: stdout        # stdout (default) | stderr | file
    file_path: /var/log/praxis/proxy.log
    non_blocking: true
    buffer_size: 8192     # buffered lines; default 128000
```

Defaults keep today's behavior: non-blocking stdout,
text or JSON via `PRAXIS_LOG_FORMAT`, lossy overflow
when the buffer is full.

`buffer_size` sizes the non-blocking queue, so it is
rejected when `non_blocking` is `false`.

Praxis does not rotate log files. With `output: file`
the log grows in place at `file_path`; rotation and
retention are the platform's responsibility (journald,
`logrotate`, or a container log driver). The simplest
setup is to log to `stdout`/`stderr` and let the
platform capture and rotate.

Changing `runtime.logging` requires a process restart;
reload validates the block but does not re-init the
subscriber.

## Full Example

A complete config enabling all observability
features:

```yaml
admin:
  address: "127.0.0.1:9901"
  metrics_address: "127.0.0.1:9902"
  verbose: true

metrics:
  filter_duration: true

listeners:
  - name: web
    address: "0.0.0.0:8080"
    filter_chains:
      - observability
      - routing

filter_chains:
  - name: observability
    filters:
      - filter: request_id
      - filter: access_log

  - name: routing
    filters:
      - filter: router
        routes:
          - path_prefix: "/"
            cluster: backend
      - filter: load_balancer
        clusters:
          - name: backend
            endpoints:
              - "10.0.0.1:8080"
            health_check:
              type: http
              interval_ms: 5000
              path: /healthz
```

This enables:

- Prometheus scraping on `127.0.0.1:9902/metrics`
- Liveness and readiness probes with verbose cluster
  detail
- Per-filter hook duration histograms
- Structured access logs with request correlation
  IDs
- Active health checks on the backend cluster
